## Usage

Go to the [Thrift Server](https://github.com/MarlinZapp/firefly-thrift-server) and [Thrift Client](https://github.com/MarlinZapp/firefly-thrift-client) repositories.

With `cargo build --release`, you can create the up to date releases of both of them.

Copy the releases into a `thrift/client` and `thrift/server` folder and adjust the paths in the `start.sh`.
